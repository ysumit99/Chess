## About the App
This app is built using ```JavaScript``` from Scratch. The idea behind creating this app was to implement JavaScript skills by building something which is non trivial and has a lot of challenges. Chess was the best option considering the amount of complexity it brings in terms of valid movement for pieces, updating the Game state in terms of board, score, timer etc. 

The performance aspect also comes into play when determining valid tiles for a piece. The App is still under development. Have a look at the MVP for the app in the *Deployed Application* section. 
## Note: 
*To best view the app, use modern web browsers like chrome/firefox on a desktop*
