## About the App

This app is built using React. The idea behind creating this app was to implement JavaScript skills by building something which is non trivial and has a lot of challenges. Chess was the best option considering the amount of complexity it brings in terms of valid movement for pieces, updating the Game state.

The performance aspect also comes into play when determining valid tiles for a piece.

## Note:

_To best view the app, use modern web browsers like chrome/firefox on a desktop_
